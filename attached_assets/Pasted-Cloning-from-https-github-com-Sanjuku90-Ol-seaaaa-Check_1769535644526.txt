(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:


- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application


- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks


- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
